Description: independent file manager with preview pane
 Icarus-FM is an independent file manager with Windows Explorer-style preview pane.
 It allows you to browse directories, preview files and launch applications associated
 with them. It works on local and remote filesystems.
 .
 This file manager is completely independent and does NOT conflict with or replace
 system file managers like Nemo. It can be safely installed alongside other file managers.
 .
 Features a preview pane with support for:
  - Images (JPEG, PNG, SVG, animated GIFs)
  - Text files (code, logs, JSON, etc.)
  - Videos (with GStreamer - optional)
  - Audio (with GStreamer - optional)
  - PDFs (with Poppler - optional)
 .
 Toggle preview pane with F7 key. Optional features require GStreamer and Poppler packages.
